# A-ML-Workflow-For-Scones-Unlimited-On-Amazon-SageMaker
I'm thrilled to embark on an intriguing project involving Image Classification.

In the world of computer vision, Image Classifiers play a pivotal role in identifying the content of images, with applications spanning across various industries. At Scones Unlimited, the potential is vast - from detecting people and vehicles in video feeds from roadways to optimizing routing on social media engagement and even identifying defects in our delectable scones. This project is a fascinating journey into enhancing our operations and delivering exceptional service.

The primary objective is to construct an image classification model capable of automatically identifying the type of vehicle our delivery drivers are using. This model is set to revolutionize our operations by efficiently routing drivers to the appropriate loading bays and orders. For instance, assigning bicycle riders to nearby orders and allocating motorcycle riders to more distant ones is a strategy that can significantly optimize our operations.

As an MLE, my mission extends beyond model creation; it's about delivering a solution that is scalable and secure. Our model needs to meet high demand and maintain its performance over time. It's crucial to implement safeguards for monitoring and controlling issues like model drift or performance degradation.

The project unfolds with the utilization of AWS SageMaker to craft a robust image classification model that can distinguish between bicycles and motorcycles. I'll deploy this model and create supporting services using AWS Lambda functions. AWS Step Functions will be employed to orchestrate the model and services into a dynamic event-driven application. The outcome will be a scalable, ML-enabled AWS applications. Let's ride this exciting journey together!"
